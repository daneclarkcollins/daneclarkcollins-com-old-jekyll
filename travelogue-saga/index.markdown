<h2>About The Travelogue Saga</h2>
<p>The Travelogue Saga is a work that has been in progress since 1996, based on notes that date back even further. It is a multifaceted, multi-world epic that spans vast amounts of time and space while keeping all of its components tightly connected in a web of synchronicity. It follows one roaming, chaotic consciousness as it explores the minds of many men and women, manifesting myth and magic in its path.</p>
<p>The Travelogue Saga is a work in progress. This page will be updated as more details emerge.</p>
