Uteria is an original fantasy world created by Michael Bielaczyc and Dane Clark Collins.

## About The World of Uteria

The world of Uteria has lived in darkness for years beyond count. It has been ravaged by plagues for hundreds of years. An ancient war ravaged the land with dark magics. For centuries, the humans have trudged along in fear of the myths and legends left over from the past.

The old kingdoms have crumbled, leaving behind city states and large tracks of unclaimed lands. In the East, the land is harsh and twisted, as the remnants of the dark sorcery used during the Aradan War have left the lands near uninhabitable, save for small pockets of civilization. In the west, in the wake of the plagues, people have become isolated and exclusive. Fear has driven people to be wary of anyone or anything new. Their superstitions have lead to witch hunts and lynching of those suspected of employing magic. People have become so downtrodden that even their belief in the deities has fallen to little more than lip service.

But all of that has begun to change in the last 20 years. Children are showing the ability to use magic—real magic. The elves have begun to emerge from their forests a full seven centuries after their disappearance. The dwarves have begun to travel and trade again. And whispers of dark powers, heroes, and a new dawn have begun to creep into this rain soaked and gray world.

It is my hope to chronicle this bold era of history as the new age dawns over Uteria.
