## A new guitar...

Let's start by going through the reasons this guitar is amazing, particularly for someone who likes to make a great variety of sounds with an instrument...

### Sustainiac pickup

In the neck position is a Sustainiac pickup. Those switches you see near the tremolo do two things: switch the sustain on and off, and switch that sustain between three varieties: standard, harmonic, and mixed.

A Sustainiac pickup allows a note to ring indefinitely. It uses magnetic feedback to make the string continue to vibrate. As the string vibrates, it triggers the pickup. As the pickup is triggered, it uses electrical magnets (or something like that) to make the string keep vibrating. This allows for all sorts of sonic possibilities.

Especially when you factor in the afforementioned harmonics mode, which will cause the strings harmonic tones to ring. Play a note, and it soon morphs into a squealy high-pitched tone. Slide the notes around, and all sorts of sounds emerge. Use the tremelo, and things get even more insane.

### Bat inlays

This do nothing for the sound, but look at them! Bat inlays!

## New music

Don't expect anything immediate, or even for the near future. But I am back in business as a musician.

With an ambitious project well underway, and several songs nearly completed, I took a long hiaitus. My lack of motivation probably was due to losing all of the files for that project due to losing both the hard drive and its backup. In addition, I began having a range of other technical difficulties, and it sapped my will.

But music is compulsive for me, so it's time to get back to work.

I haven't settled on a particular project. I was considering playing around with instrumental guitar-heavy post-progressive-rock-metal. I've played guitar for as long as I've been recording, but I've never used my guitar very much. I figure it's time to change that. But we'll see.

For a DAW, I'm trying out Reaper. So far, I think I may be enjoying it even more than Sonar, which was my DAW of choice in the past.
