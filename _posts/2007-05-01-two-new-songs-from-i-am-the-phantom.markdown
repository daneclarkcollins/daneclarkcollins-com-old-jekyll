title: Two new songs from I Am the Phantom
---

I Am The Phantom is an extremely experimental hip hop (of sorts) collaboration between myself, Squaw Music (Daniel Labrache), and Ryan Dennler.

New tracks include Daily Progress and Gypsy Vagabond, two mellow songs guaranteed to turn your mind to gelatinous ooze.
