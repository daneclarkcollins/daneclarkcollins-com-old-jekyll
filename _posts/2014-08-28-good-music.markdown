I don’t entirely mean that title. This will take a bit of explanation.

Music generally sets expectations with repeating patterns. Often those patterns follow standards set by earlier music created by earlier musicians. Twelve bar blues is one of the most repeated patterns in all of music history, and is used in most blues, blues rock, 50’s rock, and a great deal of country and standard rock music. Listen to just about any Elvis song, such as Jailhouse Rock. Zeppelin’s Since I’ve Been Loving You. James Brown’s I Got You (I Feel Good). Van Halen’s Ice Cream Man. They all follow the same pattern.

Without diving into theory (skip this paragraph if you like), the twelve bar blues pattern uses three total chords in a particular order. The chords are the root—or first (Roman numeral I)—chord of a given key (i.e. the C chord in the key of C); the fourth (IV) chord of the key (the F chord in the key of C); and the fifth (V) chord in the key (the G chord in the key of C). Keeping in mind that one bar is usually four beats, you play those three chords in the following order (with each number being played for a full bar): I, IV, I, I, IV, IV, I, I, V, IV, I, V. Then you just repeat. So in the key of C, that would be C, F, C, C, F, F, C, C, G, F, C, G, repeat. If you know how to play those three chords on any instrument, then play them in that order. You just played a blues, rock, or country song, depending on what accents you used.

I’m not trying to give a lesson here. I’m just demonstrating how specific, defined, and even documented the pattern is, and if you’ve never been educated in music, you may have never noticed, despite hearing it hundreds or thousands of times. You will, however, feel a familiarity with any song that uses it. You can sense what’s coming, because it feels natural. Even if you’ve never heard a particular song before, if a musician plays the first nine bars of a twelve bar blues, then suddenly plays a VI chord instead of the IV for the tenth bar, then it will surprise you. You’ve been conditioned with these patterns, whether you’re aware of it or not.

These patterns aren’t bad. They can help steer a song. They’re proven, and they work. The bar/measure itself is a pattern. You establish a 3/4 time signature (three beats per measure), or 4/4 (four beats per measure), and you repeat. People are used to those two particular time signatures, and they’re comfortable to listen to. They comprise most music, and almost all music you might hear on the radio.

Then you have deviations from the standards. A deviation in beats, for example, may be a 5/4 time signature (five beats per measure), like you might hear particularly in some progressive music. This makes the listener a little more curious. There may or may not be a slight discomfort invoked, but it certainly adds color that the listener can feel. Still, the pattern repeats, and the listener becomes accustomed to it. It’s harder to tap a foot or bob a head to an odd-numbered time signature, like 5/4 or 7/8, but it’s listenable—as long as it repeats and flows well. Examples of 5/4 time signatures are “Hangin’ Tree” by Queens of the Stone Age, “5/4” by Gorillaz, and strangely, “Last Night” by Vanessa Hudgens. 5/4 seems a bit odd, but it’s common enough that it won’t throw most people off too badly.

These odd time signatures can get particularly weird when fractions are used. The song “Schism” by Tool uses a 6.5/8 time signature, which is bizarre, and perhaps a little disconcerting. And still, as it repeats, it becomes familiar.

But what happens when it doesn’t repeat? What happens when one measure has 5 beats, and the next has 7? And if the next measure has 4 beats? What if there are no beats, or even patterns? Well, this may not even be called music except by appreciators of the most extreme avant-garde. Regardless, most would probably agree that deviations from the norm are good. They add color, and make music interesting. They keep the listener on her/his toes. It might be a dissonant tone in a consonant song. It might be an odd key change. It might be a change in atmosphere or tone, like a fluctuation from happy to dark, or from upbeat to brooding. Or it could be something more extreme, like a sudden crash of cacophany in an otherwise peaceful composition. Listen to Mr. Bungle for examples of that.

If the pendulum swings too much toward the expected, a few things can happen. One: boredom. It just keeps repeating. You wait for something interesting and novel to happen, and it never does. Two: trance. This sort of repetitive sound pattern, given the right kind of rhythm, can induce trance. There’s nothing wrong with that, but not every situation calls for a trance, so applications are limited. Three: dance. The last thing you want when dancing at the club is a sudden shift to a 7/8 time signature, unless it’s an interpretive dance club.

If the pendulum swings too far toward chaos, then boredom can also occur. The sounds become too random. Composition is more than just heaping together assorted sounds with no sense of order. This sort of song may no longer be able to hook into the emotions. It doesn’t pull you in. There is something about those patterns that carry us in waves along powerful rivers for the mind. That’s not to say there aren’t great avant-garde musicians who do nothing but seemingly random noise with rarely a repetition. But again, applications are limited. I use this sort of music when I need to be creative, but it only suits a very particular and rare mood.

Personally, I prefer a great deal more chaos than most people. I like patterns to be established, left long enough to build some enjoyment, then mangled, crushed, contorted, and devoured by new sounds. Most people prefer something a bit more predictable, but just unexpected enough to keep them interested. But the difference between others and me is merely in degree. The power in music is found by striking that balance: by creating expectations and then disrupting them; by shifting the listener’s mind between states of comfort and discomfort, journey and rest.
