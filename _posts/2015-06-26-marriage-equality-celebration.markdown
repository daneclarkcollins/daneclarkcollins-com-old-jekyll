Gay people never should have been excluded, but they were. No longer. Today will be noted in future history books as a day that another stone in the edifice of antique bigotry was torn down.

I’m a natural cynic. I look at the world around me and see so much needless suffering, divisions, hatred, obdurate chauvinism, and willful ignorance that I often become apathetic.

In fact, it’s become more than that. I typically feel isolated and alone. If I express feelings of empathy or compassion, people become angry with me as if my efforts at good will are a strange and contemptible deviation from the acceptable norms of humanity. I feel confused and rejected, and can do nothing but tread on and keep trying my best.

I remember, as a child, wondering if I was an alien lost among mankind. It turns out that’s a common feeling in children, but I believe that it goes away for most. Not for me. I still feel that way. I wander through life, going through the social motions, but never feeling quite connected. I feel as if my small circle of friends and family are the only real people, and the much of the rest of humanity is filled in by automatons with programming that has gone haywire, causing them to seek out conflict and strife.

I’ve become such a cynic about our governments and cultures that when something good happens in the world, I can be quick to point out the problems, or how far we still have to go.

But today, as I witness a sea of celebration across my social media channels, I feel connected. Today, I feel like we’re all human beings. I know we’re going to soon begin seeing the frantic outrage and stentorious remonstrations of the dinosaurs that history is now leaving behind. But that’s okay. Today, it’s different. I’m not one of a helpless few any more, but one of the ever-so-slowly prevailing digits of humanity. The masses are waking, and those still clutching so desperately to their tribal bigotries are going to find it is now them who suffer in isolation, while the rest of become more connected.

So for today, I’m laying my cynicism aside. For one day, I’m going to celebrate and stop thinking about how far we have yet to go.
