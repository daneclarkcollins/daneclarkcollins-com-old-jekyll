Don't worry, this isn't a marketing company, so you'll only get updates regarding my work, and those will not come often. Those who sign up may receive special pricing on this and other upcoming projects.

I'd like to thank Michael Bielaczyc for his help and support on this project, and especially for the incredible cover art that will grace the front of the book.

## Book Description:

For Toryn Ninefingers, this is almost like any other night, entertaining a rowdy crowd with song and story. But tonight, he has a special purpose in the telling of his tale, and reveals a shocking personal story that he has never told an audience before. With its telling, the world of Uteria may never be the same again.

This is the first book in the Crossroads of the Never saga, a series spanning thousands of years, shedding light on the dark and disturbing mysteries of the world of Uteriaâ€”a world besieged by the passing of a dark age, the continuing echoes of its violent history, and the recent incursion of creatures long since forgotten.
